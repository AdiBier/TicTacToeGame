# TicTacToeGame

Created TiTacToeGame in C++; 

The file TicTacToeGame.cpp contains a basic implementation in C++ without using objects or AI. It follows the Game Loop pattern.

The other files were created to introduce object-oriented programming while still using the Game Loop pattern. In this version, I implemented a basic AiPlayer to compare its performance with yours.
